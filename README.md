Overview
The challenge
Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
Any input field is empty. The message for this error should say "[Field Name] cannot be empty"
The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: name@host.tld). The message for this error should say "Looks like this is not an email"

What I learned
Implementing the client-side form validation for this challenge went easier than the previous one's, thanks to fellow Frontend Mentor developers who helped me improve the previous challenge's form validation.
